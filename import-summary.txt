ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

 * Project StarLSim:C:\Users\liangt\Documents\StarLSim\.classpath:
   Absolute path in the path entry: If outside project, may not work correctly:
   libs/gson-2.2.2.jar

 * Project StarLSim:C:\Users\liangt\Documents\StarLSim\.classpath:
   Could not resolve source path /StarLib in project StarLSim: ignored. The
   project may not compile if the given source path provided source code.


Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* AndroidManifest.xml
* StarLSim.iml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* src\ => starLSim\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
